# diff-gaussian-surfel-rasterization-w-pose

This is the rasterization submodule for the paper Gaussian Surfel "High-quality Surface Reconstruction using Gaussian Surfels". 
The pose optimization part is mainly from MonoGS "Gaussian Splatting SLAM".

If you can make use of it in your own research, please cite the original papers.

The modification of the original codes are mainly done by [@StarryN](https://github.com/StarryN) and is mainly used in [PINGS](https://github.com/PRBonn/PINGS) project.
